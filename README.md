# PROJECT ABSTRACT:

Heart plays significant role in living organisms. Diagnosis and prediction of heart related diseases requires more precision, perfection and correctness because a little 
mistake can cause fatigue problem or death of the person, there are numerous death cases related to heart and their counting is increasing exponentially day by day. To 
deal with the problem there is essential need of prediction system for awareness about diseases. Machine learning is the branch of Artificial Intelligence(AI), it 
provides prestigious support in predicting any kind of event which take training from natural events. In this paper, we calculate accuracy of machine learning algorithms 
for predicting heart disease, for this algorithm is Logistic Regression by using Kaggle repository dataset. For implementation of Python programming Anaconda(jupyter) 
notebook is best tool, which have many type of library, header file, that make the work more accurate and precise.

# DATASET:
It is using in kaggle data set = https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pritsheta/heart-attack?select=Heart+Attack+Data+Set.csv

# PROCESS:

Data preprocessing

Data Analysis

Data Visualization

Model Selection

Model Training

# CONCLUSION:

Our Logistic Regression algorithm yields the highest accuracy, 85%. Any accuracy above 70% is considered good, but be careful because if your accuracy is extremly high, it may be too good to be true (an example of Overfitting). Thus, 85% is the ideal accuracy!
